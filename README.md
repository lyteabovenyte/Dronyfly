#### Let's build AI-powered software based on SOTA models and architecture and try to capture full potential of these interesting innovations.


### Features:
- using [AI2THOR](https://ai2thor.allenai.org) as indoor data generation.


### Future:
- command-based navigation system using (Matterport3D)[https://niessner.github.io/Matterport/#download] for Voice and navigation
in continuous indoor environments
- generate physics-based data using [AI2THOR](https://ai2thor.allenai.org) and integrate physics-informed models

##### Usage:

examply usage to train any architecture in `models` directory:

```bash
python3 script/train.py --conifg path/to/configs.json --model PointNetPP
```
